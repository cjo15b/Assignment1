(a) On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

(b) 9 commits. I used "git shortlog" command to see who made commits and how many.

(c) modified last on Wed Sep 27 16:03:55 2017. I used git log to get this information.

(d) commit 36a8e55e4bbdd171ab57d979e1a802d740f2db9b
    commit cb30d72a3d94c108f393c163a35c1cc9bf18ffca

(e) One reason for using branches is so that multiple people can work on coding at once. Each person can have their own copy of the 
master file to work with. A second reason for using branches is to ensure that everyone's code works with eachothers. A programmer 
working on his branch would be able to pull changes made to the main branch to ensure that their code is functional with the rest of the 
code.

(f) git log displays a list of all commits made and their messages. 
git status tells the user if the branch is up-to-date or not, and does not show all commits.

(g) I would use the command git log Weapon.h

(h) I would use the command git log --grep=file to find commits with messages containing the word "file".

(i) Inheritance is an object inheriting it's parent(s) functionality. through inheritance new objects can receive the properties of an
 already existing object. Polymorphism is a language's ability to interpret objects differently based on the object's properties. In
 object-oriented programming encapsulation protects data from outside interference. programmers do this so that the data is not used 
in a way that it was not intended to.
